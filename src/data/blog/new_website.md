description: Wow I actually created a thing

I mostly just wanted this blog post so there would actually be something on
this baron website, so you can just ignore the rest of the page.

Before deciding on Astro, I did try out a few different static site generators,
like [HUGO](https://gohugo.io/) and [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) to get a
taste of what's out there -- I may end up moving away from this but we shall
see. My main like about Astro was `mdx`, even though I hate the format and
would prefer to try and avoid it at all costs, it just makes it easier to
customize a website in markdown without having to write pure html or a custom
style. However it is really messy with the fact it looks for javascript in the
text of the markdown (like at least give it a wrapper or something).

However I must admit, mainly with the style I'm using (which is
[astro-paper](https://github.com/satnaing/astro-paper) btw), it has so many
files and is a bit overwhelming for what seems like such a simple website. I
mean at least I didn't have to write it myself (thanks satnaing).

Speaking of the theme, why astro-paper? Well it is simple: It looks really cool
and it boasts being super accessible which I always like.

Future me: I originally wrote this in 2023 (as the date suggests) when I
was originally experimenting with this website, and I am only getting to actually
pushing it to the world in 2025. How time flies by.
