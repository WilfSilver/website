As I have already told you on the front page, my name is Hugo Whittome, but I go by WilfSilver on the interweb (yes that
is pascal case). I have not decided yet whether there should be a space between
the names so we are at the stage of like I'll do it if I'm feeling like it.

Anyhow, I am currently a Computer Science student at university exploring the
nature of the world and all that nonsense, but mostly just recapping on what I
have already found in my own time. But just so I can say big words and seem
smart: I have also been a full time professional (full stack) software
developer for over 3 years with experience in over 20 programming languages, learnt over the span of
10 years.

## Interests

My interests vary on a weekly basis (as my friend says I like to jump at
anything shiny and organise my whole life around it), but it normally derives
from:

- Internet privacy - absolute fanatic about this for some reason.
- Programming languages I like: Rust, Zig, Haskell, Perl, (fake statically typed)
  Python. I mean I have also been doing a lot of TypeScript recently.
- Linux, just Linux.
- Single player story based games
- Long walks in the countryside
- Getting distracted in the middle of a - wait how long ago was lolcode
  deprecated?
- Cool stuff

I do ask myself sometimes, is there a life out of Computer Science?

## Tech Stack

As mentioned above, these change regularly, but as of writing this, the
programs I use are:

- [Void Linux](https://voidlinux.org/) + [XMonad](https://xmonad.org/) +
  [Eww](https://github.com/elkowar/eww) (I really need to swap to Wayland at some point...)
- Some sort of Firefox-based browser (because Google). I switch quite a lot, currently I am between the [Zen browser](https://zen-browser.app/) and [LibreWolf](https://librewolf.net/)
- [AstroNvim](https://astronvim.com/) since [LunarVim](https://www.lunarvim.org/) was deprecated, unless having to use Jupyter notebooks
  (which is sadly happening more and more often) which in that case its
  [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/)
- [Proton Mail](https://proton.me/mail) with [SimpleLogin](https://simplelogin.io/) (but they have now been merged into a single thing)
- [Anytype](https://anytype.io/) for note taking which is probably a bit of an odd one out here ðŸ¤·
- YubiKey - they are so so so cool

## Past Projects

I have worked on a bunch of projects, sadly a lot of them are not open source (because work) but some of my own cool ones are:

- [Stream signer](https://github.com/WilfSilver/stream-signer) -- my dissertation, which built a specification and implementation of signing video streams to try and combat Deepfakes
- [Full Graphics Renderer in Rust](https://gitlab.com/WilfSilver/graphics-cw) -- this was a University CourseWork and I am quite proud of my achievements of making a fully fledged renderer from scratch in Rust, which included Photon Mapping blur and antialiasing features.
- [TheMazeGame](https://github.com/WilfSilver/TheMazeGame) my NEA project at A Level, a truly infinite maze generation game designed to counter overflowing bits while generating an infinite maze for you to explore using C++ and OpenGL.
- [FROOM](https://froom.bathcs.com) -- Cool project for just finding free rooms on Bath university campus (this was done with a group of friends). Has a React frontend and Rust backend
- [Basic link shortener (in Rust)](https://github.com/WilfSilver/link_shortener) -- I mean there's not really anything else to say about this
- [2in1screen but in Zig](https://github.com/WilfSilver/2in1screen) -- Quite boring, I mostly just wanted some zig practice
- [MagmaCube](https://github.com/WilfSilver/magma_cube) -- BathHack 2023 project with my friends, where we did slime mould simulation in Python and OpenGL compute shaders
- [RaceCondition](https://github.com/Please-Change) -- BathHack 2024 project with my friends, a competitive programming competition game with mario-like buffs and counters with a fatal flaw of new lines not correctly being escaped when running the tests. Used Go for the backend and Svelte for the frontend.
- [RacketReady](https://github.com/ESP-Number-One/RacketReady) -- University group coursework, where we created a (just about) progressive web app for finding pairs for different sports at the university. Used React for frontend and [TSOA](https://github.com/lukeautry/tsoa) for backend
- [BathCS Wiki](https://wiki.bathcs.com/) -- More of a side project for me at University of writing up a bunch of knowledge for hosting projects for free and some basic organisation and security procedures. Built using Astro Starlight theme (so no coding sorry)

On the side of all of this I have also setup a [kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) cluster (with [k3s](https://k3s.io/)) at home running
[Vaultwarden](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden) and [Dendrite](https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite). To back
it up I use [volero](https://velero.io/) and push to another NAS in the house. But this cluster is mostly there for me to experiment with and have a bit of fun, like setting up an LDAP server and Mailserver (both have yet to be migrated over to kubernetes though).

## Blog theme

This website is using the [astro-paper](https://github.com/satnaing/astro-paper)
because it looked cool.
